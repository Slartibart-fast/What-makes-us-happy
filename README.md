# What-makes-us-happy
Final Class Project for the UCLA Extension Data Science Course

"Data Story Final_Alexander Fichtl.pdf" is the upload of my class projects data story.

"main.R"	the single R script including all my R code for the project.

"what_makes_us_happy.ipynb" the jupyter-notebook containing some python code for things I really wanted to do but did not have the experience in R. I always tried it in R-Studio first, if I had to give up adn switch to python, I indicated this in the R script via a comment.

"responses.csv"	is the csv file containing all the data.

"columns.csv"	is a csv file containing explanations of every variable of the dataset.
